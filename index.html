			Coming from the background of a technical writer, I got to see the end result of software and I knew that I wanted to use it myself to solve people’s problems. What I find most satisfying about coding is watching a webpage, design, or component come to life on a page I’ve developed.<br> 
			When I’m not coding, you can find me geeking out over architecture, design, and grammar, playing TTRPGs, or curled up in an armchair with a good book and a cup of tea.<br>
			I can be best reached at sarahbeck104@gmail.com. <br>
			I look forward to hearing from you!
